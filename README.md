# Fitness-App-Analysis
Analysis on Fitness App data to provide insights on effect of new feature and to recipes popular amoung users

● Task One

The product team recently launched a new feature that allows users to connect with
other users to be "Buddies". Now the team is interested in how this feature impacts
session frequency and session length.

● Task Two

The recipe team asks you to help them with two requests based around the recipe usage
data:
○ Are there any recipes that are more popular during the week vs. the weekends, or
the other way around?
○ Do successful recipes have any features that distinguish them from less
successful recipes?
